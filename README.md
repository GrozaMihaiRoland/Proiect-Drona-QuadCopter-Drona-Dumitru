# Drona Quadcopter - Drona Dumitru

## Motivation
Me like drone when young, me build drone when olds or sth lol

## Overview 
A fully custom quadcopter drone featuring custom chassis modelling, PCB design, and firmware.

### 🎯 Scope
To design and build a fully functional quadcopter from scratch, integrating hardware and software systems for flight control and telemetry.

### ✨ Key Features
- Custom PCB for flight control
- using ESP32 microcontroller 
- Altimeter, Gyroscope and Accelerometer sensor fusion
- PID controller determined with a mathematical model 
- Remote controller interface using WIFI for reading telemetry data
